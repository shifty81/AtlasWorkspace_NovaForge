## Overview
The AtlasAI Broker is the intelligence layer of the workspace. It provides
debugging assistance, code suggestions, and automated tool orchestration.

## Existing Implementation
- `AtlasAI/` — canonical AI location at repo root
- `AtlasAI/Atlas_Arbiter/` — rule-based reasoning
- `AtlasAI/Atlas_SwissAgent/` — multi-tool agent
- `NF::WorkspaceBroker` — AI session management (Pipeline module)
- `NF::ArbiterReasoner` — declarative rule engine (Pipeline module)
- Pipeline tool adapters (BlenderGen, ContractScanner, ReplayMinimizer, SwissAgent, Arbiter)
